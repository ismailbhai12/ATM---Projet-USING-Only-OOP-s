# ATM---Projet-USING-Only-OOP-s
The ATM (Automated Teller Machine) project is a basic implementation of an electronic banking system. The project is designed to simulate the functionalities of a real-world ATM, allowing users to access their accounts, check balances, deposit money, and withdraw funds. There is a default PIN as it's not connected to JDBC.
